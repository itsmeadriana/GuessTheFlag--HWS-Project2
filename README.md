Days 20 - 22 of "100 Days of Swift", Project 2: Guess the Flag


Test your knowledge of flags from around the world. Choose correctly and score a point!

During this project, I learned how to implement the following: 

- Views: `VStack`, `HStack`, and `ZStack`
- Colors: as both `.foreground` and `.background` modifiers
- Gradients: `linear`, `radial`, and `angular`, including stops
- Buttons: how to use built-in system styling
- Alerts: using buttons as actionable listeners, two-way binding using the `isPresented` condition
- Arrays: using the `.shuffled()` method to randomize an array's contents
- `ignoreSafeArea()` method

(This is an educational project designed by Paul Hudson of HackingWithSwift aka @twostraws.)
